### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer at [SAP Signavio](https://www.signavio.com/). Things you find here are created in my free time. My tech stack is React, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Node.js. Besides, I found Rust a pretty interesting language to learn. My goals for 2022 are more contribution to OSS and transitioning into a software architect.

Don't forget to check out my pinned repositories! ðŸ˜„

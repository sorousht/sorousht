### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a JavaScript software developer at [Check24](https://www.check24.de/). Things you find here are created in my free time. I advise on React, TypeScript, MongoDB, and building web applications.

I found Rust a prettry interesting language to learn. My goals for 2021 are more contribution to OSS and transitioning into a software architect.

Don't forget to check out my pinned repositories! ðŸ˜„
